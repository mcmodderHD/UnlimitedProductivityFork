[mod-setting-description]
up-allow-beacon=Allow productivity modules to be used in vanilla beacons.
up-allow-all-beacons=Allow productivity modules to be used in beacons added by mods.
allow-quality-in-beacons=Allow quality modules to be used in vanilla beacons. ONLY works when productivity in beacons is enabled too!
allow-quality-in-all-beacons=Allow quality modules to be used in beacons added by mods. ONLY works when productivity in modded beacons is enabled too!
up-allow-lab=Allow all module effects on all research lab type structures.\nMight require 'Remove recipe restrictions' to be active to have any noticable effect.
up-allow-furnace=Allow all module effects on all furnaces (production machines without recipe selection).\nMight require 'Remove recipe restrictions' to be active to have any noticable effect.
up-allow-drill=Allow all module effects on all drills.\n Shouldn't do anything in vanilla.
up-allow-assembler=Allow all module effects on all assemblers.\nRequires 'Remove recipe restrictions' to be active to have any noticable effect. Shouldn't do anything in vanilla.
up-remove-all-restrictions=Removes the recipe restrictions from all other modules, including those added by mods.
maximum-productivity=up to how much you can boost a machine with productivity.
up-beacon-range=How many tiles the affected area extends from the sides of the beacon. Vanilla value is 3. 0 means 'no change'.
up-beacon-module-count=How many modules fit in one beacon. Vanilla value is 2. 0 means 'no change'.
distribution-effectivity=The multiplier of the module's effects, when shared between neighbors.
distribution-effectivity-quality=How effective beacons are per quality level
beacon-quality-module-slots=How many modules fit in one beacon per quality level
beacon-quality-range=Range Increase of Beacons per quality level
